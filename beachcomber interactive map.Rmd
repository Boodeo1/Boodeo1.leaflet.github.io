## Creating Interative Maps with leaflet

This assignment uses the maps of Mauritius island, which is located in the Indian Ocean, to highlight some of the best hotels in the country from one of the Hotel holding companies, Beachcomber Hotels. The group has 9 hotels in total, out of which 5 are highly rated. This map will show these 5 hotels on the map of Mauritius and will also include markers (corporate icon) and the respective web addresses as popups.
